# whale

An open Twitter GraphQL API service.

## Quickstart

You can directly use the API through the URL provided at the top of this [GitHub page](https://github.com/rootasjey/whale).

## Rate limits

If you use the available free service from this repo, you should know that there're [rate limits](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/rate-limits) enforced by Twitter.

The provided online service should only be used for light experiments.

If you plan to make hundreds of API calls, you should:

* Create a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/)
* Apply for [a developer account](https://dev.twitter.com/)
* And create an [app](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps).

## Purpose

As I was developping a react frontend app experiment, I didn't find a quick way to search for tweets containing specific keywords.

The [Twitter official documentation](https://developer.twitter.com) doesn't say how to fetch data from a frontend app.

I decided to build a server for my personal use and for others if you find it useful.

You can either use the available URL at the top if this page or deploy your own server on any cloud service.

> Note that the API usage is restricted by [Twitter usage limitations](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/rate-limits).
